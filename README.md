This is the screen recording of the game in action!

I've created a game using JavaScript on the platform p5.js, incorporating various commands like Math.round, isTouching, random(), and lifetime() and many more commands to bring it to life. In this game, a bow moves along the y-axis following the cursor, while colorful balloons appear randomly on the screen. When the player presses the 'L' key, an arrow is shot; if it hits a balloon, the balloon pops, and the score increases by one. Additionally, the background scrolls in the opposite direction, adding a dynamic touch to the gameplay.
